# Python-Crossing-Game
Crossy Road Style Game Made in Python 
This game was made in conjunction with a tutorial made by StackSkills. In this game, I used Pygame to utilize many functions and render tools
that made building the game a little easier. The code is broken up into the various classes and utility sections to make it easier to read. 

This was my first exposure to Python after coding exclusively in C++.
